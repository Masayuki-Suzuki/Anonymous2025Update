Anonymous Front-end Developer - 2025 Update Project
---

Anonymous Front-end Developer is my personal blog and a long-term project aimed at showcasing my skills through hands-on development. This site is intended to document my development process, progress updates, and any thoughts that come to mind along the way.

The project is very much a work in progress and will be updated regularly.

### ðŸ§  AI-Driven Development
I actively incorporate modern tools such as large language models (LLMs) throughout the development process â€” from design and prototyping to implementation and content creation â€” as part of an ongoing effort to explore the future of AI-assisted software engineering.
